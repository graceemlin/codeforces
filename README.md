Solutions are organized into folders, each corresponding to a specific Codeforces contest.\
Like many competitive programmers, I utilize C++ for its performance and comprehensive Standard Template Library (STL).\
Please excuse the occasional lack of comments and any stylistic errors. \
During competitions, my primary focus is on solving problems efficiently.
